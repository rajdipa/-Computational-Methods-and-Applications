**compute_Euclidean_norm.m** - computes the Euclidean norm for an arbitary input vector x.  <br />
**matrix_times vector.m** - computes the product between an n-dimensional square matrix and an n-dimensional column vector<br />
**pi_series.m** - retuns the first 15 partial sums of a pi series and estimates the convergence order of the series.<br />
**chord_method.m** - takes a nonlinear equation and implements the chord method to find the zeros. <br />
**test zero.m** - computes an approximation of the smallest zero of the fifth-order Chebyshev polynomial and plots the convergence history.<br /> 
**Lagrange_interpolation.m** - computes the Lagrangian interpolant of a given set of data points <br />
**test_Lagrange_interpolation.m** - computes the Lagrangian interpolant of a polynomial that interpolates the set of data in Evenly-spaced grid and in a grid with Chebyshev-Gauss-Lobatto points. Also plots the  the Lagrangian interpolants obtained by using the two different grids. <br />
