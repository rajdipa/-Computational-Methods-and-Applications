compute factorial.m - takes an integer number as input and returns the factorial without using the built in factorial function. 
compute Euclidean norm.m - computes the Euclidean norm for an arbitary input vector x.  
matrix times vector.m - computes the product between an n-dimensional square matrix and an n-dimensional column vector
pi series.m - retuns the first 15 partial sums of a pi series and estimates the convergence order of the series.
chord method.m - takes a nonlinear equation and implements the chord method to find the zeros. 
test zero.m -
